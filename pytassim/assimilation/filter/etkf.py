        Parameters
        ----------
        state : :py:class:`xarray.DataArray`
            This state is updated by this assimilation algorithm and given

        observations : :py:class:`xarray.Dataset` or \

        pseudo_state : :py:class:`xarray.DataArray`

             :py:class:`~xarray.DataArray` should have four coordinates, which

        Returns
        -------
        analysis : :py:class:`xarray.DataArray`

    This is an implementation of the `ensemble transform Kalman filter`
    :cite:`bishop_adaptive_2001` for correlated observation covariances.
    This ensemble Kalman filter is a deterministic filter, where the state is

    weight space, which are then applied to the given state. This implementation

    assumption :cite:`hunt_four-dimensional_2004` and ensemble smoothing.

    Parameters
    ----------
    smoother : bool, optional
        Indicates if this filter should be run in smoothing or in filtering
        mode. In smoothing mode, no analysis time is selected from given state
        and the ensemble weights are applied to the whole state. In filtering
        mode, the weights are applied only on selected analysis time. Default
        is False, indicating filtering mode.
    inf_factor : float, optional
        Multiplicative inflation factor :math:`\\rho``, which is applied to the
        background precision. An inflation factor greater one increases the
        ensemble spread, while a factor less one decreases the spread. Default
        is 1.0, which is the same as no inflation at all.
    gpu : bool, optional
        Indicator if the weight estimation should be done on either GPU (True)
